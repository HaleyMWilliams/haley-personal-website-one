                Following the acquisition of her Bachelor of Science in Human Communication from the

                lifelong dream of moving to New York City to pursue a career in fashion.
                Fast forward through three years of working in both the fashion and

                Since beginning her coding journey in June of 2020, Haley has had the opportunity
                to design and build numerous front end and fullstack web applications, both independently and under 
                freelance/consultant contracts, allowing her to bring clients' and personal visions to life, work

<!-- Following the acquisition of my Bachelor of Science in Human Communication and 3 years of working in the fashion 
  and retail industries, I found my true passion in coding. Since making the leap to Web Development in June of 2020, 
  I have gained hands on experience designing and building several front end and fullstack web based applications and 
  websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL and React, allowing me to flex my creative muscles, as well as my 
  analytical and problem solving skills. 

This experience has led me to pursue a career in Front End Development, an opportunity that allows me to utilize my wide 
range of strengths and interests. I am passionate about this new chapter of my professional life and am eager to contribute 
my skills and grow with a company full time within the tech space. With an industry that is in a constant state of change, I am 
enthusiastic and eager to learn new coding languages, continue building upon my existing coding knowledge, hone my skills 
and work hard to become the best developer I can be.
