           <h1>About Haley</h1>
              <p>
                Hard work, attention to detail, enthusiasm and high-quality results are the name of Haley’s game! 
              </p>

              <p>
                Following earning her Bachelor of Science in Human Communication and three years of 
                working in the fashion and retail industries, Haley found her true passion in Product 
                Development - whether that be writing the code herself or helping to strategize and 
                deliver valuable product to consumers. Since making the leap to development in June 2020, 
                she has gained hands on experience designing, building, and delivering several front end 
                and fullstack web based applications and websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, 
                SQL and React, allowing Haley to flex her creative muscles, as well as her analytical and 
                problem solving skills. 
              </p>

              <p>
                After learning how to code, working on personal and freelance development projects, 
                working with many talented individuals and being exposed to different areas of product 
                development, Haley has decided to pursue a career in product ownership, an opportunity 
                that utilizes her wide range of strengths and interests. As a front-end developer with 
                a background in customer service and public relations, she brings a unique perspective 
                to product ownership and can view problems through a unique lens and provide creative 
                and effective solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Haley is passionate about this new chapter of her professional life and is eager to 
                contribute her skills to and grow with a company full time within the tech space. 
                With an industry that is in a constant state of change, Haley is enthusiastic and eager 
                to implement new methodologies and strategies, hone her skills and work hard to deliver 
                high-quality products and results.
