      <p>
        Haley Williams is a recent SheCodes Plus React graduate whom is excited
        to utilize her new skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and more by
        beginning a career in tech. She is hardworking, passionate and
        enthusiastic, and is guaranteed to deliver results beyond expectations.
      </p>

      <p>
        After earning her Bachelor of Science in Human Communication from the
        University of Central Florida in 2017, Haley decided to follow her
        lifelong dream of moving to New York City to pursue a career in fashion.
        Fast forward through three years of working in both the fashion and
        retail industries, Haley found her true passion in coding.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through SheCodes Plus React coding bootcamp, Haley had the opportunity
        to design and build a weather app - in both JavaScript and React -
        allowing her to flex her creative muscles, and further explore her
        analytical and problem solving skills. This experience has led Haley to
        pursue a career in Front End Web Development, an opportunity that allows
        her to utilize her wide range of strengths and interests.
      </p>

      <p>
        Haley looks forward to this new chapter of her professional life and is
        eager to begin a career in the tech space. With an industry that is in a
        constant state of change, Haley is enthusiastic and eager to learn new
        coding languages, continue building upon her existing coding knowledge,
        hone her skills and work hard to become the best developer she can be.
